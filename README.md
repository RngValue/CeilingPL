<p align=center><strong>Ceiling is a simple and easy to use compiled programming language.<br> It's currently being developed by a high school IT student for no actual reason.</strong></p>
<p align=center><sub><sub>(I am seriously considering changing the logo...)</sub></sub></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The Ceiling Compiler is written in C++ and compiles your project into C code, which is then compiled using gcc. <br><sub><sub>(Basically, make sure you have gcc working)</sub></sub></p>
<h3>How to compile your project</h3>
<p>Works similarly to how you would compile your project using gcc/g++. (Depending on the operating system, you would want to include a file extension like ".exe")</p>
<pre><code>ceilbuild -o [path to your .ceil file] [path to your final executable file]</code></pre>
<p>You can also check your compiler's version by doing this.</p>
<pre><code>ceilbuild -v</code></pre>
<h3>The documentation:</h3>
<p>To check all the "opcodes" and the syntax, do this.</p>
<pre><code>ceilbuild -h [page number]</code></pre>
<p>I am currently not working on a proper documentation yet, so this is all you get at the moment.</p>
<h3>How to quit Vim:</h3>
<p>Just in case...</p>
<pre><code>:q!</code></pre>
<p>It's not related to Ceiling, just wanted to let you know. :3</p>

<h2>Future plans so far</h2>
<h3>Some of the things I have in mind include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adding SDL support, because GUI slaps hard</li>
  <li>Making web scraping easier, because the reddit api pricing is a joke</li>
  <li>Libraries, because... libraries are pog</li>
</ul>
<p><sub>(None of the above is guaranteed to happen tho...)</sub></p>
