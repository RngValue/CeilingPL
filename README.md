<p align=center><strong>Ceiling is a simple compiled programming language.<br> It's currently being developed by a high school IT student for no actual reason.</strong></p>
<p align=center><sub><sub>(I am seriously considering changing the logo...)</sub></sub></p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The Ceiling Compiler is written in C++ and compiles the language into C code, which is then compiled using gcc.</p>
<p>You would compile your project using terminal command:</p>
<pre><code>ceilbuild -o [path to your .ceil file] [path to your final executable file]</code></pre>

<h2>Future plans so far</h2>
<p>Some of the things I have in mind include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding SDL support, because GUI slaps hard</li>
  <li>Making web scraping easier, because the reddit api pricing is a joke</li>
  <li>Winning the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
  <li>Becoming a corporate entity</li>
  <li>Getting drowned in money and fame</li>
  <li>Enslaving entire nations</li>
  <li>Becoming the leader of the whole universe</li>
  <li>Adding Functions</li>
</ul>
<p><sub>(None of the above is guaranteed to happen tho...)</sub></p>
