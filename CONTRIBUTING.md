<h1>Contributing to CeilingPL</h1>
<p>Your input is valuable. We care about all your:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bug reports</li>
  <li>Feature proposals</li>
  <li>And contributions</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to contribute</h2>
<p>Contributing is as simple as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Forking the <code>main</code> branch</li>
  <li>Making changes</li>
  <li>Opening a pull request</li>
  <li>And waiting for feedback. Sometimes we might merge your additions into the <code>main</code> branch without questions</li>
</ol>

<h2>Following Code Patterns</h2>
<p>Follow these rules and you should be ok:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Due to my own error, indentations are 4 spaces long</li>
  <li>Do not nest more than 3 times. And if you really need another if statement or a loop, make it a one liner</li>
  <li>The use of comments is optional, but be sure to use comments to justify your complicated implementations</li>
  <li>Declare variables at the very top of the code. We don't declare variables in loops</li>
</ul>
